/*
Given a positive integer n, count the number of digits in n that divide n evenly (i.e., without leaving a remainder). Return the total number of such digits.

A digit d of n divides n evenly if the remainder when n is divided by d is 0 (n % d == 0).
Digits of n should be checked individually. If a digit is 0, it should be ignored because division by 0 is undefined.

Examples :

Input: n = 12
Output: 2
Explanation: 1, 2 when both divide 12 leaves remainder 0.
Input: n = 2446
Output: 1
Explanation: Here among 2, 4, 6 only 2 divides 2446 evenly while 4 and 6 do not.
Input: n = 23
Output: 0
Explanation: 2 and 3, none of them divide 23 evenly.

CODE:

class Solution {
    static int evenlyDivides(int n) {
        int temp=n,dig;
        int count=0;
        while(n>0){
            dig=n%10;
            if(dig!=0 && temp%dig==0){    //  checking dig != 0 bcos of divide by zero error.
                count++;
            }
            n=n/10;
        }
        return count;
        
    }
}
