Given a number n, find the value of n raised to the power of its own reverse.

Note: The result will always fit into a 32-bit signed integer.

Examples:

Input: n = 2
Output: 4
Explanation: The reverse of 2 is 2, and 22 = 4.
Input: n = 10
Output: 10
Explanation: The reverse of 10 is 1 (leading zero is discarded), and 101 = 10.
Input: n = 3
Output: 27
Explanation: The reverse of 3 is 3, and 33 = 27.

CODE:

class Solution {
    public int reverseExponentiation(int n) {
        int temp,i,dig,ans=0,res=1;
        temp=n;
        while(n>0){
            dig=n%10;
            ans=(ans*10)+dig;
            n=n/10;
            
        }
        // power of a and b without pow() function.
        int base=temp;
        int exp=ans;
        for(i=1;i<=exp;i++){
            res=res*base;
        }
        return res;
    }
}
